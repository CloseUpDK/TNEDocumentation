<i><b>The economy plugin for server owners that want more out of their economy.</b></i>
</p>

### Intro
So, you're ready to start working on your servers economy? Well, you've come to the right place! I'll presume
you've already downloaded TNE, and have basic knowledge of configuration Bukkit plugins, which also includes
configuring how your data is saved. If you need more information on configuring your database settings. Check
out the [Database Page](Database.md), and if you need more information on installing TNE check out the Installation
section below.

### Installation
In order to install TNE you simply download the file from the Spigot Page, and drop it into the plugins folder of your 
server directory. Afterwards, make sure to run your server once just to generate the default configurations unless you
have downloaded them from the git page prior. From here you have two options, use the default configurations or customize 
TNE to suite your economic needs.

### Configuration
For the configuration portion of this, I'll be referring you to the [Configurations Page](Configurations.md).

### Now What?
From here, you have an incredible amount of control over your server's new economy. With TNE you're able to control almost 
every detail for each feature. Make sure to check out these pages to properly interact with your new economy:
